* read-in data
  - visualize the distribution of data to decide which threshold of IC50 to use
  - filter out non-binders (ic50 = 10,000 nM)
  - decide which alleles to use
  - cluster peptides with Hobohm and heuristics (1/r\*s)
  
* construct the PSSM for X MHC I alleles (X = 20)
* visualize the PSSMs as logos
* do prediction with PSSM
* compute against published data
